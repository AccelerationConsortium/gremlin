Kernel learning guided high-throughput synthesis and characterization of mixed metal oxides 


What if you could go beyond just predicting success from limited high-throughput data and actually understand which regions of your experimental design space are most likely to work, and why?ðŸ”¬

We explored this on the synthesis of the Feâ‚‚(ZnCo)Oâ‚„ mixed metal oxide spinel using a robotic platform, and identified the key conditions for forming a single, stable phase via kernel learning and explainable AI. This was done by defining a global SHAP analysis across a synthetically generated design space to interpret which parameters most positively influence synthesizability. Interestingly, even from the very limited data, our model's explainability aligns well with theory. Global SHAP is particularly useful if you're looking for comprehensive, interpretable insights into the average behavior of a model across a dataset, rather than focusing only on individual instance-level explanation
